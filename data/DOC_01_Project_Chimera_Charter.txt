1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Executive Summary
Following the strategic acquisition of "DataFlow Inc" (APAC region) and "StreamLine Analytics" (EMEA region) in Q4 2023, Nexus Corp currently operates with three disjointed data ecosystems. This fragmentation has resulted in significant operational inefficiencies, including a 40% increase in data latency and discrepancies in global financial reporting.

Project Chimera is initiated to unify these disparate data streams into a singular, governed Data Lake architecture. This initiative is not merely technical but a strategic prerequisite for the upcoming AI Analytics rollout planned for late 2024.

1.2 Business Justification
Current state analysis reveals that cross-subsidiary reporting takes approximately T+3 days. The target state enabled by Project Chimera is T+1 hour. This reduction is critical for the Finance department's "Real-Time Ledger" initiative.

2. PROJECT SCOPE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 In-Scope
The following activities are explicitly within the scope of Project Chimera:
- Design and deployment of a centralized Snowflake Data Warehouse.
- Migration of 50TB of historical transaction data from legacy SQL Servers and Oracle DBs.
- Development of "Module A": A real-time Data Ingestion Pipeline using Apache Kafka and Spark.
- Development of "Module B": Data Transformation and Normalization layer.
- Implementation of standardized Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) across the new platform.
- Decommissioning of the legacy "DataFlow" on-premise servers.

2.2 Out-of-Scope
- Development of frontend visualization dashboards (assigned to the UX/UI Guild).
- Migration of Marketing and HR data streams (deferred to Phase 2).
- Training of end-users (handled by the L&D department).
