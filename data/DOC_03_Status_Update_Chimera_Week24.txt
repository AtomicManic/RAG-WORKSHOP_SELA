EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Project Chimera is formally moving to RED status this week. The catastrophic failure documented in incident INC-409 has revealed critical technical debt in the Ingestion Pipeline (Module A). The engineering leadership has mandated a freeze on new feature development to focus entirely on stability and refactoring.

2. KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS (LAST WEEK)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Completed post-mortem analysis for INC-409.
- Module B (Warehousing): Completed schema definition for the Finance tables.
- QA Team: Finalized the automated regression suite for the API layer.

3. CRITICAL ISSUES AND BLOCKERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE #1: Ingestion Module Refactor
- Description: The RCA for INC-409 requires a full rewrite of the connector logic.
- Impact: This work was not in the original plan. It is estimated to take 6 weeks of dedicated engineering time.
- Action: All "Nice-to-have" features are deprioritized.

ISSUE #2: Alpha Launch Delay
- Description: The "Alpha Launch" milestone (M5), originally scheduled for July 15, is no longer achievable.
- New Forecast: August 25, 2024.
- Impact: This pushes the project completion perilously close to the Q3 financial audit deadline.

4. UPCOMING MILESTONES (REVISED)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- June 20: Refactor Architecture Review
- July 10: Refactor Sprint 1 Complete
- July 30: Refactor Sprint 2 Complete
- Aug 25: Alpha Launch (Delayed)

5. RISK MANAGEMENT UPDATE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Risk Identified (ID: R-45):
"Stakeholder misalignment due to delays."
Mitigation: PM to schedule emergency alignment sessions with Finance and Ops stakeholders.

Escalation Note:
Per the Corporate Risk Policy, since the project is now in RED status and the delay exceeds 4 weeks, we are preparing the mandatory documentation for the executive review board.

6. BUDGET UTILIZATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Budget Spent to Date: $1.1M
Remaining Budget: $1.4M
Forecast at Completion: $2.6M (Potential overage of $100k due to extended contractor hours).
